    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
      I'm an independent DevOps consultant based in Ontario, Canada. I help businesses design and maintain scalable infrastructure with a focus on automation, reliability, and simplicity. My work centers on turning complex setups into clean, maintainable systems that are easy to understand and support.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
      I work with tools like Terraform, Docker, and GitHub Actions, and deploy to platforms including Azure, GCP, AWS and Oracle Cloud. I also build and manage self-hosted services where it makes sense, keeping everything secure and easy to update.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
      I take a practical approach. The goal is not just to get things working, but to build systems that stay out of the way and hold up over time.
